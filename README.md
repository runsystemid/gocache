# Gocache

This library is a shared package for standardized cache implementation.

## What is cache?

A cache is a high-speed data storage layer which stores a subset of data, typically transient in nature, so that future requests for that data are served up faster than is possible by accessing the data's primary storage location.

## Installation

You can run this in your terminal

```shell
go get -u github.com/runsystemid/gocache
```

Import this library in your main function or bootstrap function.

```golang
import "github.com/runsystemid/gocache"
```
